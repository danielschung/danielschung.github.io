      <h1>Who</h1>
      <p>I'm Daniel, a creative and digital native who is passionate about authoring powerful multimedia. Media is a broad category, spanning across mobile technologies, streaming services, products in app stores, social media, search engines, news outlets, and more, all on platforms that are increasingly disruptive to the average user. For years I've been jumping at any opportunity to expand my reach in the digital realm and learn something new, all because I believe that media is powerful. Screens have the power to win elections, start movements, hack statistics, drive spending economy, shape cultural beliefs, change the narrative and more. This kind of influence is what I always strive for in my work, and why I love what I do.</p>

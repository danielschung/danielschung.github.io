				<p class="title">The Problem</p>
				<p class="large">Shopping for health insurance plans can be confusing, and we saw a large number of frustrated shoppers bypass our digital experience for service calls. Yet the process for connecting with a representative was archaic. Questions went long unanswered and phone lines become more congested. We determined that a live chat feature was an elegant way to immediately address a major digital experience issue.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="slide-up">
				<p class="title">The Ask</p>
				<p class="large">To create a chat solution on Health Alliance's primary shopping site to allow customer interfacing with the sales team. This would assist in the conversion of prospective customers and help acquire lead data into Salesforce.</p>

					<h2>Research and Analysis.</h2>
					<h2 class="accent">Digital front-door competitor review.</h2>
				</span>
				<span class="slide-up">
					<p class="large">To get an idea of the industry standard, I started by observing various chat interfaces from a few digital front-door competitors including BlueCross BlueShield and Home Depot.</p>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="numbers">
				<p class="large slide-up"><span>BlueCross Blue Shield</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used a virtual assistant named "Ask Ivy." The technology was smart and recognized text based input, routing the user to knowledge pages throughout the site. Yet Ivy had a difficult time answering specific questions since no direct human chat could be initiated.</p>
				<p class="large slide-up"><span>Home Depot</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Started with an automated triage to get a general idea of what the user was looking for, then a direct chat with a human representative was established. This felt like a good solution, but the chat experience was minimal and lacked elegance in the design.</p>

				<h3>Product Vision</h3>
				<p class="large ">Based on our findings, we determined that a <strong>virtual assistant</strong> which eased the user into a connection with a <strong>human representative</strong> felt like the best solution for our needs. The chat  also needed to have an <strong>elegant design</strong> that you would expect from a credible shopping tool.</p>

				<h2 class="accent slide-up">Investigating our options.</h2>
			</span>
			<span class="slide-up">
				<p class="large">To increase sales, we thought a Salesforce Lightning app would serve well to acuire lead data and store chats on the back-end. We consulted a few internal Lightning developers to see what was possible. The plan was to build a Lightening app, set up the piplines to pass desired user data via API call, and build out a polished front-end.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="slide-up">
				<p class="large">Over the next few weeks I mapped out the product requirements with stakeholders and developers, establishing vision and communicating everything across the board. The plan was received well, and we pulled together an initial roadmap to hit production in 3 months or less.</p>

			</span>
			<span class="slide-up">
				<p class="large">In an effort to avoid bombarding the user with personal questions upon initiating the chat, I spent some time figuring out how to get these crucial data points to the sales team in a way that didn't sacrifice the user experience.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="slide-up">
				<p class="large">I pulled together initial flows and wireframes for the chat bearing in mind a primary question: <strong>How can we make an impersonal data gathering sequence feel smooth and unobtrusive?</strong></p>

			<span class="slide-in">
				<p class="overline">Persistence in shared understanding is key.</p>
				<p class="large">Design thinking is valuable, but persistence is necessary because people tend to lose sight of what you are building and why. I realized that we needed frequent meetups with the team to reiterate the context of our product and cover any gaps in shared understanding.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="slide-in">
				<p class="overline">Collaboration is innovation.</p>
				<p class="large">Building personal relationships doesn't just make a project more enjoyable, it also creates collaborative relationships which nurtures an environment to discover the best solution together.</p>

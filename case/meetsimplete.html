      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>When Health Alliance created a new High Performing-Network of Care (HPNC) product line called Simplete, they need a landing page to launch the product and convert interest into a new, prospective customer base.</p>
      <p>The initial outcome was to have a site that peaked the interest of prospective members satisfied the expectations of existing ones , all while being a part of a larger marketing initiative for the Simplete brand.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Through primary stakeholder meetings, one challenge that immersed was branding control. The new product was created in partnership with Memorial Health who wanted equal control of how the product was branded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-container">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Since both Health Alliance and Memorial Health wanted to maintain customer expectations, we needed a site that introduced the product as a separate brand from other product lines, but still allowed both users to feel at home.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Requirements</p>
      <p>The plan was to work with Memorial Health to create an instant quote tool that provided pricing solution for prospective customers and stored customer data to transition users into our conversion cycle. Providing leads that allowed the Health Alliance team to follow-up helped cushion our users into the product.</p>
      <p>To clarify enterprise partnership and establish the brand early on, we had a short video that highlighted the planâ€™s most marketable traits.</p>
      <p>A common issue with the health care product is information that is difficult to digest. To make this information more approachable, we built a plan picker tool that filtered by customer need.</p>

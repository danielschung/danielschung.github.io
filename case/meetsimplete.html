      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>When Health Alliance created a new High Performing-Network of Care (HPNC) product line called Simplete, they need a landing page to launch the product and convert interest into a new, prospective customer base.</p>
      <p>The initial outcome was to have a site that peaked the interest of prospective members and satisfied the expectations of existing ones , all while being a part of a larger marketing initiative for the Simplete brand.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Through primary stakeholder meetings, one challenge that immersed was branding control. The new product was created in partnership with Memorial Health who wanted equal control of how the product was branded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Since both Health Alliance and Memorial Health wanted to maintain customer expectations, we needed a site that introduced the product as a separate brand from other product lines, but still allowed both users to feel at home.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Requirements</p>
      <p>The plan was to work with Memorial Health to create an instant quote tool that provided pricing solution for prospective customers and stored customer data to transition users into our conversion cycle. Providing leads that allowed the Health Alliance team to follow-up helped cushion our users into the product.</p>
      <p>To clarify enterprise partnership and establish the brand early on, we had a short video that highlighted the planâ€™s most marketable traits.</p>
      <p>A common issue with the health care product is information that is difficult to digest. To make this information more approachable, we built a plan picker tool that filtered by customer need.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Testing & Feedback</h2>
      <p class="left">Testing was conducted throughout the entire process to identify major pain points. Prototypes created using Sketch and InVision were presented to stakeholders for early feedback to help guide each iteration.</p>
      <p class="right">The site was launched after numerous user pilot meetings in August of 2018. Google Tag Manager pixel tracking was included to gather user data throughout the site.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p class="left">After many iterations and revisions we felt we had achieved a landing page that acted as the final point of the conversion cycle for prospective customers. We were proud of the result that gave the Simplete product digital presence to increase customer base and grow the bottom line.</p>

      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p>Product is discovered in design, not set prior.</p>
      <p class="left">In developing a product, rapid iteration in design and development produces the best results. This occurs best through achieving a shared understanding of the product constantly through the lifecycle with all parties involved.</p>
      <p class="right">I also gained valuable experience in guiding the development of a dynamic design system, which allows for rapid production and increased brand consistency.</p>

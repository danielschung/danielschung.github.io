      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="large">MeetSimplete is a landing page to introduce the newest insurance product line at Health Alliance. The initial outcome was to offer digital interaction and conversion toward a new customer base.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="screen meet-simplete-hero"></div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Through primary stakeholder meetings, one challenge that immersed was branding control. The new product was created in partnership with Memorial Health who wanted equal control of how the product was branded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Since both Health Alliance and Memorial Health wanted to maintain customer expectations, we needed a site that introduced the product as a separate brand from other product lines, but still allowed both users to feel at home.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Requirements</p>
      <p>The plan was to work with Memorial Health to create an instant quote tool that provided a pricing solution for prospective customers and stored customer data to transition users into our conversion cycle. Providing leads that allowed the Health Alliance team to follow-up helped cushion our users into the product.</p>
      <p>To clarify enterprise partnership and establish the brand early on, we had a short video that highlighted the planâ€™s most marketable traits.</p>
      <p>A common issue with the health care product is information that is difficult to digest. To make this information more approachable, we built a plan picker tool that filtered by customer need.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Testing & Feedback</h2>
      <p class="left">Testing was conducted throughout the entire process to identify major pain points. Prototypes created using Sketch and InVision were presented to stakeholders for early feedback to help guide each iteration.</p>
      <p class="right">The site was launched after numerous user pilot meetings in August of 2018. Google Tag Manager pixel tracking was included to gather user data throughout the site.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p class="left">After many iterations and revisions we felt we had achieved a landing page that acted as the final point of the conversion cycle for prospective customers. We were proud of the result that gave the Simplete product a strong digital presence to generate a new customer base for a high-performing product.</p>

      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p class="left"><strong>Data drives product</strong> <br>Data gathering can steer product decisions like which solutions work and which don't. Data can help shape the larger marketing strategy. Without it, advising stakeholders as designers can be a challenge.</p>
      <p class="right">A lot the process for great results comes down to articulating decisions with data that aligns with larger business goals. Being able to lead and advise others involved toward a better product often comes down to clear communication and presentable data.</p>

    <h2 class="first">Objective</h2>
    <p class="large">To improve retention rates for drivers at Marvin Keller, a transportation company.</p>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Due to the difficulty of the industry, the turnover rate for drivers is extremely high. The opportunity cost for one driver for one year is around $75,000, so the company wanted a solution to boost retention.</p>
    <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
    <p>I rode with a driver for a day to observe his interactions with the company and to ask him questions about his daily routine.</p>
    <p>I then created a survey based on these results to find if other drivers felt similarly. We had around 70% of all company drivers participate in the survey.</p>
    <h3>Synthesis</h3>
    <p>The survey revealed 3 key trends:</p>

    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Drivers needed a <strong>convenient</strong> way to absorb company culture.</li>
      <li>Drivers needed to feel <strong>empowered</strong> to contribute their ideas.</li>
      <li>Drivers needed motivation to <strong>engage</strong> with the platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <p>The solution was to develop a convenient platform to expose drivers to the Marvin Keller brand and provide a company wide sphere full of content including news, announcements, updates, photos, tips, etc. Since the content is about themselves, written by themselves, it would be content they want to read.</p>

    <h3>Mobile</h3>
    <p>The mobile platform makes the solution <strong>convenient</strong> to access from truck stops, hotels, and restaurants across the country.</p>

    <h3>Submission Form</h3>
    <p>The form provided drivers a way to submit content from any location on any device. It is meant to empower drivers by encouraging them to provide input.</p>

    <h3>Launch Campaign</h3>
    <p>We launched a campaign with digital marketing materials and supplementary brochures aimed to help drivers feel appreciated for their input.</p>

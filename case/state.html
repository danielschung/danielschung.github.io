      <h2>Overview & Problem</h2>
      <p class="large left">Our largest employer groups generate a large portion of business, but their custom pages were outdated and minimal, providing only basic plan information.</p>
      <p class="large right">We wanted to overhaul each site's experience to provide a well-intended upgrade with a personal touch to better reflect their value to the enterprise.</p>

      <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="left">To discover how users would their sites, we needed more context into each employer group. We began a research phase starting with State of Illinois (the largest group) and decided to use this group to establish the direction for the other groups.</p>
      <p class="right">The overhaul would include a series of sites broken out into eight user groups. From there we planned to develop consistency through a micro design system deployed throughout each of the other sites.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">User Research</p>
      <p>As we investigated State of illinois, four primary users emerged: current employees from organizations in Illinois, retired employees of community colleges, retired teachers in Illinois, and local government health plan purchasers.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Insights</p>
      <p>In analyzing competing plans for the State of Illinois market, we determined that a marketably advantageous benefit for us was an extensive provider network for students. Because of this, a significant portion of this group (either for themselves or for a dependent) would be enrolled in a university, community college, or local educational program.â€¨ Because of this, we decided it would be beneficial to focus on participants of educational programs.</p>

        <p class="subhead">Home Base</p>
        <p>In targeting participants of educational programs, we fleshed out a section that served as a breakout point to elaborate on the benefits for various educational program participants.</p>

        <p>We leveraged a feature on MyBenefits.illinois.gov to help users further understand their benefits, and included a breakout section to highlight this feature.</p>

      <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
      <p>We liked the way the new site looked and felt, and the next phase was to implement the research process and new design across the other employer group sites. I developed a SCSS style library and used it to rebuild the other sites. Since I had the responsibility for both design and development, I was able to organically grow the system over time and handle rapid iterations and quick deployment. The outcome was a near, pixel perfect product achieved on both mobile and desktop endpoints.</p>
      <p class="subhead">Feedback & Iteration</p>
      <p>I worked directly with stakeholders across the organization throughout each phase of the project to communicate business impact and to guide and articulate major design changes across the board. All new sites were launched between April and November of 2019.</p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>We were pleased with the results of a successful design overhaul. Our work also laid the groundwork for an iterative design model driven by a deep understanding of our users. We continued evaluating our choices and growing the design system each iteration.</p>
      <p class="subhead">Tracking Metrics</p>
      <p class="note left-30">Data was gathered using Google Analytics tracking methods</p>

      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p class="left"><strong>Product is discovered in design, not set prior.</strong> <br>In developing a product, rapid iteration in design and development produces the best results. This occurs best through achieving a shared understanding of the product constantly through the lifecycle with all parties involved.</p>
      <p class="right">I also gained valuable experience in guiding the development of a dynamic design system, which allows for rapid production and increased brand consistency.</p>

      <h2 class="left">Overview</h2>
      <p class="left">The goal was to rework sites from a subsection of Health Alliance’s largest employer groups and create design consistency across all endpoints. Each site provides customers access to their coverage, benefits, and plan details.</p>
      <h2 class="Right">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="right">Employer groups comprise a large percentage of revenue, but their pages on the Health Alliance website were cluttered. The larger rework was needed to reflect the value Health Alliance has toward their employer groups.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="screen state-hero"></div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="left">We began the research phase by collecting data from analysts and coordinators throughout the organization. As we got more context into the other employer groups, we thought State of Illinois was a</p>
      <p class="right">good starting point in directing the larger rework for other employer groups. From there we could develop a design system and extend consistency throughout this entire site subsection.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">User Research</p>
      <p>We investigated State of illinois and boiled it down to four primary users: current employees from organizations in Illinois, retired employees of community colleges, retired teachers in Illinois, and local government health plan purchasers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">Personas</p>
      <p class="note left-30">Two personas helped jumpstart our user journey process</p>
      <div class="stats right">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="persona"></div>
          <p>Illinois Employees with children or other dependents enrolled in a university, community college or other local educational program</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="persona"></div>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">Insights</p>
      <p>We then analyzed competing plans of other health care providers for the State of Illinois market and determined that a marketably advantageous benefit for us would be an extensive provider network for students. Because of this, a significant portion of this group (either for themselves or for a dependent) would be enrolled in a university, community college, or local educational program. </p>
      <p>We would need to accentuate the benefits for participants of educational programs. To convert traffic toward enrollment, we would need to target users who valued a larger provider network for university and community college attendees.</p>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <div class="text-container left-40">
        <p class="subhead">Home Base</p>
        <p>We arrived at a section that served as a breakout point to specific pages to further break down bulky health care information for each subcategory. Users could use this to better understand the benefits of each plan.</p>

    <div class="container text-photo">
      <div class="text-container left-40">
        <p class="subhead">Benefits</p>
        <p>We leveraged MyBenefits.illinois.gov to help users further understand their benefits, so we also included a breakout section to promote this feature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="snippet state-benefits right"></div>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="container text-photo">
      <div class="text-container left-40">
        <p class="subhead">Focus</p>
        <p>We also included a breakout section for the College Extended Network Program at Health Alliance to reach current and future participants of educational programs.</p>

      <div class="snippet state-focus right"></div>
      <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="container text-photo">
      <div class="text-container left-40">
        <p class="subhead">Retention</p>
        <p>Lastly, we pointed users to other plan options within Health Alliance to maintain traffic and keep users within the conversion cycle.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Bringing it all together</p>
      <p>We liked the way the new site looked and felt, and the next phase was to implement the new design and UX process across the other employer group's personal sites. This was achieved through a custom built Sass library that offered usability for sites in this category. Since I had the responsibility for both design and development of this category, I was able to touch both sides of the design and development process. The outcome was a near, pixel perfect product achieved on both mobile and desktop endpoints.</p>

      <h2>Testing & Feedback</h2>
      <p class="left">I worked with stakeholders across numerous departments throughout the research and design process to ensure business requirements were being</p>

      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p class="left"><strong>Product is discovered in design, not set prior.</strong> <br>In developing a product, rapid iteration in design and development produces the best results. This occurs best through achieving a shared understanding of the product constantly through the lifecycle with all parties involved.</p>
      <p class="right">I also gained valuable experience in guiding the development of a dynamic design system, which allows for rapid production and increased brand consistency.</p>

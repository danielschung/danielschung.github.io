    <h2 class="first">Objective</h2>
    <p class="large">Reworking a series of sites to better reflect value of the largest employer group in an insurance network.</p>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>The largest group of customers at Health Alliance consists of employees who work for the state of Illinois. Each subtype of government employee had websites linking to various PDFs containing personalized information pertaining to plan pricing, plan benefits, and plan perks, but the sites themselves were minimal and difficult to use. We needed an overhaul to fully reflect the value of our most profitable customers.</p>
    <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
    <p>The first step in the research process was collecting a compilation of user data provided by analysts and coordinators throughout the organization. I wanted to understand exactly who was lumped together into this large employer group and what information they needed most.</p>
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>We broke down the user data to reflect four primary users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Current employees from various organizations in Illinois</li>
      <li>Retired employees of community colleges</li>
      <li>Retired teachers in Illinois</li>
      <li>Users who purchased insurance through a local government health plan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From analyzing our user base and analyzing competing plans in the market, a few primary trends emerged.</p>
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>A significant portion of this group (either for themselves or for a dependent) was enrolled in a university, community college, or local educational program. This was because the <em>extended provider network for students</em> was the primary <strong>marketably advantageous</strong> benefit of the program.</p>
    <p>Aside from personalizing plan information, plan benefits, and plan perks, <strong>we needed to display the major competitive aspects of each plan</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Digital Strategy</h2>
    <p>To start thinking through content strategy, we defined two personas. Embodying two of the most frequent use cases was helpful in making decisions. We mapped out user journeys for our marketing personas.</p>

    <h3>User Journeys</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clara is an existing member who uses the site for annual plan <strong>renewal</strong>, plan <strong>maintenance</strong>, and accessing <strong>plan coverage</strong> info</li>
      <li>Rob is a prospective member who as a shopper uses the site to compare <strong>prices</strong>, view <strong>benefits</strong>, and access <strong>enrollment</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bringing it All Together</h2>
    <p>We liked the way the new site looked and felt, and the next phase was to implement the new design across the other employer group sites. I developed a SCSS style library and used it to rebuild the other sites. Since I had was doing both design development, I was able to organically grow the system over time and handle rapid iterations and quick deployment. The outcome was a near, pixel perfect product achieved on both mobile and desktop endpoints.</p>
    <h2>Feedback & Iteration</h2>
    <p>I worked directly with stakeholders throughout each phase of the project to communicate business impact and to articulate a major design overhaul. All new sites launched between April and November of 2019.</p>
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>We were pleased with the results of a successful design overhaul. Our work also demonstrated value to implement an iterative design model driven by a deep understanding of our users into our future process.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>State of Illinois page traffic increased by 228%</li>
      <li>SOI retiree traffic increased significantly by 1467%</li>
      <li>IA-retire traffic increased by 111%</li>
      <li>Reid-retiree increased by 93.75%</li>
      <li>All CIP, TRIP, LGHP, state-employee increased by 78.27%</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Learnings</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Drives Product</strong> - Data gathering can steer product decisions like which solutions work and which don't. Data can help shape the larger marketing strategy. Without it, advising stakeholders as designers can be a challenge.</p>
    <p>A lot the process for great results comes down to articulating decisions with data that aligns with larger business goals. Being able to lead and advise others involved toward a better product often comes down to clear communication and presentable data.</p>

				<p class="title">The Problem</p>
				<p class="large">Each State of Illinois employee that purchased a healthcare plan through us was directed to a primitive website that simply linked to various PDFs containing general plan info like pricing, benefits, and perks.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="slide-up">
				<p class="title">The Ask</p>
				<p class="large">The site's design was extremely basic without any kind of polish or thought put into it. It surely did not reflect the value of our largest employer group. Given that this page had the highest traffic and bounce rate on our site, it needed a major overhaul to better service this group and market our plans.

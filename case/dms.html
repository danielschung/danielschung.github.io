      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>As a traditional health insurance provider, a significant aspect of Health Alliance’s customer experience is interaction with PDF documents. The Document Management System is a digital solution to improve management and hosting of all documents used on public facing platforms. It also acts as a source of truth for all document metadata used across the organization.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="left">There wasn’t a clear or established process for maintaining documents used by all customers and shoppers. As a method of control, information and files would have to go back in forth in email threads across departments in order to keep documents updated and consistent across all endpoints.</p>
      <p class="right">As the volume of documents was over 1,000 and documents needed to be updated frequently, we needed to create a process and implement automation as much as possible to reduce production time and increase accuracy in delivery.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
      <p class="left">I had the unique responsibility of having to maintain and track all 1,000+ documents throughout our public sites and portals, so I had the subject matter expertise to pinpoint major system problems.</p>
      <p class="right">I conducted research by gathering data from code repositories and had a number of discussions with primary document coordinators about various cases in document management.</p>

      <h2>Testing & Feedback</h2>
      <p class="left">Testing was conducted throughout the entire process to identify major pain points. Prototypes created using Sketch and InVision were presented to stakeholders for early feedback to help guide each iteration.</p>
      <p class="right">The site was launched after numerous user pilot meetings in August of 2018. Google Tag Manager pixel tracking was included to gather user data throughout the site.</p>

      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p>Product is discovered in design, not set prior.</p>
      <p class="left">In developing a product, rapid iteration in design and development produces the best results. This occurs best through achieving a shared understanding of the product constantly through the lifecycle with all parties involved.</p>
      <p class="right">I also gained valuable experience in guiding the development of a dynamic design system, which allows for rapid production and increased brand consistency.</p>

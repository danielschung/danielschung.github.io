      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="large">The Document Management System (DMS) is our digital system to control and host all documents used through enterprise websites. The system was able to solve a major process issue for the organization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="screen dms-hero"></div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="left">As a traditional health insurance provider a significant aspect of Health Alliance’s customer experience is interaction with PDFs, but there wasn’t any process for maintaining or tracking docs throughout the hundreds of sites. Document metadata and files would constantly go back in forth through email and slack threads in order to maintain documents that needed to be live for all users.</p>
      <p class="right">With the volume of unique documents being over 1,000, the number of tickets pertaining to adding and updating documents often were lost in a stack, left unaddressed for months, and often redundant. We realized quickly that we needed to investigate the process problems and automate a solution to reduce document production time and deliver more accurately.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
      <p class="left">I began researching the problem by talking with primary plan coordinators about various cases in document management to pinpoint the primary process issues.</p>
      <p class="right">From there, I had a good idea of what to look for and continued gathering data from code repositories and key analysts.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Synthesis</p>
      <p>In Summary, there was <strong>no source of truth</strong> for document metadata that everyone needed. The process of managing and updating documents <strong>took too much time</strong>. The result of these two issues led to documents <strong>being placed inaccurately</strong> throughout all endpoints.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>We needed to construct a <strong>database</strong> and work with developers to <em>add the capability to store documents and their metadata</em>.</p>
      <p>We needed to create a <strong>user interface (UI)</strong> to allow subject matter experts across the organization to <em>control the database directly</em> by adding, editing, and removing document metadata.</p>
      <p>We needed to <strong>automate a solution</strong> to allow non-tech savvy document subject matter experts to <em>have control over public links to documents</em> throughout all sites and portals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">Product</p>
      <p class="left">We looked into various existing products to see if we could find one to suit our needs. Over the next few days I worked closely with a Software Architect to research potential products we could use.</p>
      <p class="right">We determined that the products offered did not meet our custom requirements and decided to start pulling together resources to build a solution in house.</p>

    <p class="subhead">Bringing it all together</p>
      <p>We designed a few concepts and worked with key stakeholders across the organization for feedback. We cycled through numerous revisions through pilot and stakeholder meetings, and worked with developers to build the product in a short timeframe.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Design System</p>
      <p>As we further hashed out the DMS, we realized that we had no design system for internal products. We thought it would be a good opportunity to lay the groundwork for a design system to have tight control over design and speed up development by taking ownership of styling. I got the chance to build a style library with working components using JavaScript and SCSS. The <a href="https://www.healthalliance.org/design-system" target="_blank">design system</a> was released on our primary code repository to test components in our environment and provide documentation for developers.</p>
      <p>Alongside the DMS which solved a major process issue in our organization, we also ended up with a design system to maintain brand consistency and speed up development for future internal products.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p class="left">Document management is a complex process that involves a lot of different players. The way that a primarily non-digital organization handled this complex task was by developing a manual process that was slow and introduced errors by nature.<br><br>One of the main hurdles we faced was persistently advocating a new solution that required replacing a habitual process with design thinking philosophy. I met with subject matter experts (SME) frequently to provide consultation for the implications of the new system and guidance in questions asked.</p>
      <p class="right">We also conducted training sessions with SME’s throughout the testing phase to accustom them to the product and make adjustments from learning how they would use it. Throughout the process of winning over stakeholders and developing the product, the solutions offered were met with a mutual understanding across the board of the value the product brought to the table.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p class="left"><strong>Persistence in shared understanding is key.</strong> <br>Design thinking is valuable, but persistence is necessary because people tend to lose sight of what you are building and why. Frequent meetups with your team can be very effective in reiterating the context of a product and covering any gaps in shared understanding.</p>
      <p class="right">Building personal relationships doesn't just make project more enjoyable, it also creates collaborative relationships which nurtures an environment to discover the best solution together.</p>

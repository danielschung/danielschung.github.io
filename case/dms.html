      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>As a traditional health insurance provider, a significant aspect of Health Alliance’s customer experience is interaction with PDF documents. The Document Management System is a digital solution to improve management and hosting of all documents used on public facing platforms. It also acts as a source of truth for all document metadata used across the organization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="left">There wasn’t a clear or established process for maintaining documents used by all customers and shoppers. As a method of control, information and files would have to go back in forth in email threads across departments in order to keep documents updated and consistent across all endpoints.</p>
      <p class="right">As the volume of documents was over 1,000 and documents needed to be updated frequently, we needed to create a process and implement automation as much as possible to reduce production time and increase accuracy in delivery.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
      <p class="left">I had the unique responsibility of having to maintain and track all 1,000+ documents throughout our public sites and portals, so I had the subject matter expertise to pinpoint major system problems.</p>
      <p class="right">I conducted research by gathering data from code repositories and had a number of discussions with primary document coordinators about various cases in document management.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">Synthesis</p>
      <p>In Summary, There was no source of truth for document metadata that everyone needed. The process of managing and updating documents took too much time. The result of these two issues led to documents being placed inaccurately throughout all endpoints.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p class="left">We looked into various existing products to see if we could find one to suit our needs. Over the next few days I worked closely with a Software Architect to research potential products we could use.</p>
      <p class="right">We determined that the products offered did not meet our custom requirements and decided to start pulling together resources to build a solution in house.</p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="subhead">Requirements</p>
      <p>We needed to construct a database and work with developers to add the capability to store documents and their metadata.</p>
      <p>We needed to create a user interface (UI) to allow subject matter experts across the organization to control the database directly by adding, editing, and removing document metadata.</p>
      <p>We needed to automate a solution to allow non-tech savvy document subject matter experts to have control over public links to documents throughout all endpoints.</p>
      <p class="subhead">Bringing it all together</p>
      <p>We designed a few concepts and worked with key stakeholders across the organization for feedback. We cycled through numerous revisions through pilot and stakeholder meetings, and worked with developers to build the product in a short timeframe.</p>

      <p class="subhead">Design System</p>
      <p>I had the opportunity to use this project to spearhead implementation of an internal design system that extended design control and dev consistency throughout new products. I worked to build a reusable component and styling library with JavaScript and SASS. The design system was launched on our primary code repository to test components in our environment and provide documentation for usability.</p>
      <p>The result was an extensive document management system that solved a major process issue in our organization as well as a design system to maintain brand consistency and speed up development for future products.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p class="left">Document management is a complex process that involves a lot of different players. The way that a primarily non-digital organization handled this complex task was by developing a manual process that was slow and introduced errors by nature.<br><br>One of the main hurdles we faced was persistently advocating a new solution that required replacing a habitual process with design thinking philosophy. I met with subject matter experts (SME) frequently to provide consultation for the implications of the new system and guidance in questions asked.</p>
      <p class="right">We also conducted training sessions with SME’s throughout the testing phase to accustom them to the product and make adjustments from learning how they would use it. Throughout the process of winning over stakeholders and developing the product, the solutions offered were met with a mutual understanding across the board of the value the product brought to the table.</p>

      <h2>Product Learnings</h2>
      <p>Persistence in shared understanding is key.</p>
      <p class="left">Design thinking is valuable, but persistence is necessary because people tend to lose sight of what you are building and why. Frequent meetups with your team can be very effective in reiterating the context of a product and covering any gaps in</p>
      <p class="right">shared understanding. Personal relationships don’t just make projects more enjoyable, it also creates collaborative relationships which nurtures an environment to discover the best product together.</p>
